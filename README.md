# NOMBRE
This is a game based off of wordle where you guess a 5 digit string. You have 10 attempts and under 60 seconds to get the correct answer. This code was programmed in Java. I have added a sound track to the background and a timer. As you take your attempt each one is met with feedback to improve your guess for the next attempt. I have done this by implementing arrows up, down or a tick to show if your guess if correct or too high or low. I have implemented input validation to ensure that only numbers are entered into the text field.
